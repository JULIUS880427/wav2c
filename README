1) use audacity to create the file with the right settings: 8KHz, 8bit, mono. Do it with WAV export
2) audacity will always leave a tail, making the file suck big time. Therefore trim it with: sox fifiu.wav fifiu-cut.wav trim 0 10000s
3) export it to text with: wav2c fifiu-cut.wav fifiu.h sounddata
